# beautifulBinaryString
Let's say that a string s is a Binary string, if it consists of only A and B characters, i.e. for each valid i s[i]='A' or s[i]='B'.

Let's call a Binary string a Beautiful Binary string, if it is possible to connect pairs of equal letter with lines above the string so that no two lines intersect and each character is connected to exactly one other character.

Given a Binary string, determine if it is Beautiful.
